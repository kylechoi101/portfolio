        <p>
            Highly motivated Data Science student with a strong passion for financial markets and quantitative analysis. 
            In my recently completed Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) program level 1, 
            I was able to achieve a grade exceeding 90th percentile especially excelling in fixed income and portfolio management. 
            
            Proficient in Python, SQL, and statistical analysis. 
            I excel in data-driven problem solving, and I am eager to apply my skills to optimize trading strategies and enhance portfolio management.
